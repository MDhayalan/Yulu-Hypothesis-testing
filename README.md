# Optimizing Yulu's Micro-Mobility Sales through Data Analysis

<p>In this project, 
  I performed an extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Yulu's bike-sharing data to uncover key user behavior patterns and propose actionable strategies to improve sales and engagement. 
  Through detailed visualizations and hypothesis testing, 
  I analyzed the impact of factors such as weather, seasonality, time of day, and user types (casual vs. registered).</p>

## Key contributions:
- Identified high-demand seasons and time slots to optimize bike availability.</br>
- Recommended strategies to increase registered user retention and convert casual users.</br>
- Proposed data-driven marketing initiatives tailored to weather and regional preferences.</br>
- Suggested operational improvements to enhance user satisfaction and boost revenue.</br>
- This project highlights the power of data in driving innovation within the urban mobility ecosystem.
